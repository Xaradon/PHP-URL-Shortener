## Benefits

- Can shorten over 42 billion unique URLs in 6 or less characters (it can do more than 12,000,000 in only 4!)
- Extremely fast: uses very little server resource
- Minimalist front end: make your own
- Includes an API so you can create your own short URLs on the fly
- Option to turn clickthru tracking on and off
- Option to limit usage to 1 IP address for personal use and to prevent spamming from others
- Only uses alphanumeric characters so all browsers can interpret the URL
- Secure: several data filters in place to prevent SQL injection hacks
- Option to check if the URL is real (doesnâ€™t respond with a 404) before shortening
- Uses 301 redirects for SEO and analytics
- Option to store a local cache to prevent database queries on every redirect
- Option to change the characters allowed in a shortened url

## Using your personal URL shortener service
